# Retail-Management-Database-System-MySQL-
End-to-end relational database design and implementation using MySQL for a retail business scenario.

This project involves the designed and implemented an end-to-end relational database system for a retail business scenario as part of an academic project.
The project involved analysing business requirements and translating them into structured conceptual and logical data models, followed by physical implementation using MySQL

## Overview
Key features of the project include:
• Conceptual and logical ERD design with clearly defined entities, relationships, and constraints
• Normalisation up to Third Normal Form (3NF) to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy
• Implementation of the database using MySQL, including table creation and data population
• Development of SQL queries demonstrating joins, nested subqueries, aggregate functions, and data manipulation (insert, update, delete)
• Modelling real-world retail processes such as customer orders (in-store and delivery), inventory management, supplier purchasing, and employee roles

## Deliverables
- Conceptual and Logical ERDs
- Normalised relational schema (3NF)
- MySQL scripts for database creation, population, and querying

## Technologies
- MySQL
- SQL
